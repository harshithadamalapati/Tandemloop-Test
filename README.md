# Java Programming Test – Basic Problem Set

Name: Harshitha Damalapati  
*This repository was created as part of a coding assessment. The solutions are written in **Java** and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.*

---
 Language Used

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **JDK Version**: Java 8 or higher  
- **Structure**: Each program is saved in its own file with meaningful class names and inline comments for clarity.

 Program-1.java` – Calculator

- **Functionality**: Performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input:  
  `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`
- **Highlights**:
  - Uses `Scanner` for user input
  - Handles invalid operations and division by zero
  - Demonstrates method and exception handling

---

 Program-2.java` – Odd Number Series Generator

- **Functionality**: Prints the first `n` odd numbers starting from 1.
- **Highlights**:
  - Demonstrates basic loop constructs
  - Arithmetic logic for generating odd numbers

---
 Program-3.java` – Adjusted Odd Series Generator

- **Functionality**: Similar to Program-2, but reduces even input by 1 to generate an odd-count series.
- **Highlights**:
  - Conditional logic to adjust even input
  - Clean loop for series output

---

Program-4.java` – Divisibility Counter

- **Functionality**: Counts how many elements in an array are divisible by numbers from 1 to 9.
- **Highlights**:
  - Demonstrates nested loops and modulus logic
  - Uses `LinkedHashMap` to maintain output order
  - Practical example of collections and frequency counting
